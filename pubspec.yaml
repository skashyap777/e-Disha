  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # Generate localization files
  generate: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - .env

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font.
    # Example of another font family
    # - family: Poppins
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
